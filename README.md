# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This study guide is the source of information that will be taught during the bootcamp course. I am often tediously organizing notes to try to keep up with the course. Unfortunately, this practice allows for some items to fall through the cracks; creating gaps in my knowledge base. Having this study guide to consistently update throughout the course will allow for fresh ideas and information to be documented in an organized manner.
